    testimonial: '“My daughters attended a few days of the summer camp last year and had an amazing time! They really enjoyed all the activities, especially the kayaking. The staff are very experienced and are really good with all the kids. My daughters will definitely be back this half-term and also in the summer. Highly recommended for a fun and exciting alternative to the usual summers camps!!!”'
