    testimonial: |-
      Amazing afternoon out, a totally different experience!

      Amazing way to see our local area from a new angle. It was fun, exciting and incredibly tranquil too. We spent three hours kayaking (from Burnage rugby club to Jackson's Boat) and I can highly recommend it – quite a work out too! Would be great for friends, families or couples. The staff were friendly, kept the instructions simple, and setting off and pick-up was smooth and easy.
