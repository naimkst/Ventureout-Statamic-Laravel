                text: "We don't recommend trying our archery with children younger than 8 y.o. because the bows are then taller than the child and they are very hard to draw the string back.  It takes finger and shoulder strength to draw back the string and then hold it whilst you aim.  This is why the session are only about 1 hour long - it is tiring and can hurt the fingers.  We do have finger protectors on our small bows."
