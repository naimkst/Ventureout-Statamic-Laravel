    testimonial: |-
      A great afternoon out!

      This was the second time weâ€™ve hired a rafted canoe from Burnage rugby club to Northenden (another birthday treat for our son whoâ€™s 10!) we had 2 6 year olds & 3 adults on board too & we all loved every minute-the highlight was going down the weir at the end! We saw lots of herons & other wildlife; a brilliant way to spend a Sunday afternoon! Thank you!!
