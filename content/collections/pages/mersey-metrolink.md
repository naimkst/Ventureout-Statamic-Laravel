      Kayaking is great fun!

      As a family group with an age range from 6 to 58 we all had a fantastic time. We did the self guided kayak route down to Jackson Boat. The weir at Northenden and the rapids were great fun.
      You are given good safety instructions at the start and the staff were all very helpful. We would all thoroughly recommend this activity.

      Re connecting as a family. 10/10

      Well organised, professional and friendly. Great information provided on your booking email. Clear instructions and easy to follow. Good safety information before you start off. The River is easy to navigate and is easy for youngish children to people with a few years under their belts. Fitness wise most will be able to do this. Be prepared for those pelvic muscles and thighs to be tested. Give some thought to changing out of wet clothes at your end point. We were are a family of four on two double kayaks. The double kayaks allow one person to take a rest from paddling. We had a great laugh doing this… and amazingly we had a great conversation with our teens for a whole afternoon. 10/10 and we’ll certainly be doing it again.
