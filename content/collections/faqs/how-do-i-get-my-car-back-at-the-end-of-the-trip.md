We do not provide transport to get you from the Get Off point back to the start. Most groups leave a car at the get off point before coming to the start.
How this works: Everyone in your group meets at the get off point, gets changed and leaves their change of clothes in some cars at that car park. They all car-share to the get on point (normally our centre in Heaton Mersey) Remember to bring the car keys for the cars left at the get off. Also bring your waterproof coat and trousers, even on a sunny day)
Alternatives:
 - Book a taxi/minibus taxi to meet you at the end point - remember to bring towels and bin bags to sit on as they may refuse to take you if you are wet. We can bring your change of clothes to the get off point. 
 - Book our ‘Metrolink Paddle’ to Jackson’s Boat Pub as this has Metrolink stations at both the start (East Didsbury Station) and end (Sale Waterpark). 
- Book our ‘Metrolink Paddle’ and then hire bikes from The Bike Barn at Jackson Boat Pub and cycle back to our base. The bikes can be picked up by the Bike Barn for a small charge. Please check that both bikes and trip is available beforehand.
 - Come on your own bike and we bring your bike to the Get Off point on our canoe trailer. You must bring a lock and the bike remains your responsibility whilst locked to our canoe trailer.
