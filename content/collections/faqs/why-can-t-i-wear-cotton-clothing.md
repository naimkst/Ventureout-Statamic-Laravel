Cotton absorbs lots of water and dries very slowly.  It also loses all of its ability to insulate you.  So if your cotton t-shirt, hoodie or tracksuit bottoms get wet, you will be cold and uncomfortable. Synthetic fibres (polyester/nylon), that most fleeces, sports tops and base layers are made from are lighter, warmer and safer.
