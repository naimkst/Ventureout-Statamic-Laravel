Yes â€“ this is a great idea, you will want to record all of those great DofE memories. They can then be uploaded onto your eDofE or used during your presentation. You might even want to consider entering your photos into our Snap Happy Photo Competition. If you do bring a camera or video camera, please ensure that it is well protected from the elements.
