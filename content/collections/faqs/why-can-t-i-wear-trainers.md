In order to safely take part in an expedition you must have proper walking boots which cover the ankle bone. These must have soles with good grips and heels. Slips in grass and mud are common, and this is dangerous with a heavy bag on.  
You will be walking though wet grass and mud, even on the campsite.  This will wet your socks and this is the biggest cause of blisters.  
If you do not have proper walking boots you will not be able to take part.
