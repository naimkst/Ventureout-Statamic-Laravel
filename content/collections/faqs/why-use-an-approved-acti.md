### Our safety & experience 

Before a team sets off by themselves on their assessed expedition, it is imperative that participants are properly equipped, attend quality training events run by professional staff, and that supervision and safety systems are in place. Providing this for numerous teams would be a huge responsibility for a school as they usually lack the staff, experience, technical background, equipment and insurance required. It is much safer for all to employ specialist providers (AAP).  Venture Out Expeditions is an Approved Activity Provider for The Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. This audit process ensures that our programmes provide the participants with the best possible staff, training, equipment and safety supervision systems.
