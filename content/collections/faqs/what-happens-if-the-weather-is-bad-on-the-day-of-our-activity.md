It is an outdoor activity centre, with no indoor space.  But some of our activities areas and the lunch area are covered/sheltered.
Sadly, we do not have control of the weather, but we always suggest appropriate activities for the season when you are booking. Follow our advice on what to wear to make sure everyone can take part in their outdoor experience, regardless of the conditions. 

In exceptional circumstance such as the river flooding it may be necessary to offer an alternative activity or postpone to another date.
