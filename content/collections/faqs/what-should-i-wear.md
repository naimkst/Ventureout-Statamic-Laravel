We recommend you wear old trainers or wet shoes and a lightweight waterproof jacket, with a fleece top or thermal underneath. Please do not wear jeans, flipflops or crocs. 
We give you a buoyancy aid and a helmet which must be worn when on or next to the river. We also have some salopettes that can be hired for Â£2 cash on the day.
Make sure you bring a change of clothes in case you get wet!
