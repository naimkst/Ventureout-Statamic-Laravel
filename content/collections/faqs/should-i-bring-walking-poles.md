Some participants find walking poles very useful, when used correctly they take some of the weight off your legs and can help you to balance when walking on rough ground. They are particularly useful for participants who suffer from ankle, knee, back or hip problems.  We really recommend them for Gold expeditions as the days are very long and the uphill and downhill sections are very long and hard.
