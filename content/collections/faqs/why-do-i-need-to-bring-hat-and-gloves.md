Even in the middle of summer it can be very cold on the hill top or at night. The temperatures in towns and cities where you live are often warmer than where your expedition will be.  The weather forecast is not reliable and changes over the days.  If there is an emergency you may have to put clothing on and wait hours for help.
Therefore it is essential that you can keep yourself warm and bring everything marked 'compulsory' on the kit list.
