Welfare and safety is our biggest priority when working with teams and hypothermia is a common issue so you will not be able to take part unless you are properly equipped. 
It is a personal development award which encourages participants to take responsibility for planning, preparing and packing well before they come. 
Our Safety operating procedures require the staff to check all participants clothing at the start of each event.  This is also part of the assessment process.
We bring a small stock of spare kit to each expedition so your instructor may be able to help. But it is impossible for us to bring enough spares in different sizes.  If it is wet and cold and you do not have safe clothing you will need to go home.  That is for everyone's safety.
