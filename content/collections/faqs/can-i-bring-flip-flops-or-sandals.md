This isn’t necessary, however if you don’t mind carrying a little more then you may want to bring a different pair of shoes to wear in camp. You should not walk barefoot around the campsite because the grass is cut by a tractor that will chop up tent pegs and leave sharp things hidden in the grass on the fields.
