We are a British Canoeing Delivery Partner and we hold a licence with the Adventurous Activities Licencing Authority (Reg no: L11326/R1942). Licence details can be confirmed by telephoning the Health & Safety Executive or visiting their website. This licence requires us to be inspected, have Public Liability Insurance, have Risk assessments, operating policies and procedures. It also requires that we use only qualified staff who hold recent CRB checks and First Aid certificates. If you require any further documentation, please visit our Downloads page for copies of our documents.
