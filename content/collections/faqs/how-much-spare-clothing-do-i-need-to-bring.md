These are not 'spare' clothing - they are extra layers to put on top of what you are wearing.  So when it gets colder at night or on the hill tops or in the rain, you have extra layers in your bag to keep you comfortable day and night, regardless of what weather you get.  
So this will depend on the length of your expedition, but as a minimum, in addition to the clothing you are wearing, you will need a warm jumper and a complete change of clothing.
