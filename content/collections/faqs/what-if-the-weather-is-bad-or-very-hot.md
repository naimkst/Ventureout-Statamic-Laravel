We will run activities pretty much whatever the weather! It's an outdoor activity scheme and we have no indoor space.  We will adapt the program to suit. This means it is essential you send your child with the appropriate clothing to enable them to be comfortable outside from 8am to 5pm in the rain, cold or sun.
