Yes â€“ but you will not be allowed to use it day or night.  We give you tough plastic bags to seal the phone into.  The seals are checked at the end of the event to ensure you have not used it.  You carry it in case of an emergency or in case you need to call your parents at the end of the event. Please ensure that it is fully charged, has plenty of credit and is well protected from the elements in a tough plastic bag.
One person in your team is allowed to keep their phone turned on to take photos of your expedition or record evidence for your expedition project.
