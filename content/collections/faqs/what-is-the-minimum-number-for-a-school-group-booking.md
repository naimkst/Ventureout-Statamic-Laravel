We can run Bronze, Silver & Gold DofE walking Expeditions for between 4 to 20 teams at a time.  For Gold walking expeditions the minimum number is 2 teams or 12 participants.  

For canoeing expeditions it is 2-3 teams - 6 or 8 students per team. That can seem like very few students but a canoe only holds 2 participants so two teams of 8 students is already 8 boats that fill one canoe trailer.
