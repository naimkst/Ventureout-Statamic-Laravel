No experience is needed for any of these trips. The river is grade 1 with a few easy Grade 1-2 rapids. We regularly take adults and children who have never been in a boat and who may not be able to swim. Capsizing is rare and the river is shallow and usually slow flowing. Everyone wears a buoyancy aid, helmets (kayak only) and our experienced River Leaders hold national qualifications.
Groups are given a safety brief before they launch and then we drift along for a bit whilst paddlers get the hang of it. For large groups or nervous groups, we raft the canoes together to make them impossible to capsize and easier to steer.
