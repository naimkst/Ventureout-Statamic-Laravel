We offer a variety of watercraft options...
Canoe: 3 Seats for two adults and small child or for 3 children (U-13)
Note: Canoes cannot be hired out on the river due to problems rescuing these if they capsize.
Rafted Canoes: 2 canoes secured together with wooden spar.
Impossible to capsize. Team craft for up to 6 adults. Perfect for non-swimmers or nervous participants.
Sit-on-Top kayak (SOT kayak): Wide, stable craft which is difficult to capsize and easy to rescue. No possibility of entrapment. 
Double SOT kayak: Two person craft for up to 2 medium size adults. Faster and straight running. Easier for going longer distances
Kiwi kayak: 2 small adults or 1 adult and child.
Very stable and straight running. Has a cockpit but very unlikely to entrap if capsized.
