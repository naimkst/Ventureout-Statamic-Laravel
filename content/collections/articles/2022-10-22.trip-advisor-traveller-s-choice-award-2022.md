        text: "3 years in a row we have been awarded this award for all our 5 star reviews.  We are consistently rated #1 in Stockport.  It's no wonder we consider ourselves to be South Manchester's best kept secret - so few Mancunians and Stopfordians (yes, that's the term - I looked it up ;) know that they can Venture Out canoeing  on the Mersey.  This is especially rewarding considering the difficult Covid years we all had in the region."
